    # Note: Persistent disks and health checks can be configured in the Render dashboard
    # or with the provider's exact manifest schema. These fields were removed to
    # avoid schema validation errors in the editor. If you want the manifest to
    # create a disk and configure a health check automatically, tell me and I
    # will update this file after confirming the exact Render manifest keys.
